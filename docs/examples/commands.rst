Commands
========

Commands that you can use for your bot (json data)
--------------------------------------------------

.. Tip::
    Guidelines for these commands:

    must be:

    - Useful
        - something that will actually be used
        - can't be overly complicated.
    - Unique
        no duplicates of commands
    - Sufficiently Complicated
        - No commands with just one argument, these are best used for massive commands with many subcommands.
        - eg. a simple ``ban`` command is not sufficient, but a ``ban`` command with support for both temp bans, soft bans, etc. is ok.

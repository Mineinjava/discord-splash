Welcome to discordSplash's documentation!
=========================================
Discord: coming soonâ„¢

.. Warning ::
   You must make your own slash commands via discord API

DiscordSplash is an easy-to-use api wrapper for the Discord Api (specifically Slash Commands and interactions)

This module was made because the `discord.py <http://github.com/rapptz/discord.py>`_ module does not support Interactions.

This project is still in beta.

Installation
############
Installation is through pip.

.. code-block::

   pip install discordSplash

Voice Support
#############

DiscordSplash currently does not support voice. This may change in the future.
